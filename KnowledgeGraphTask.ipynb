            "Kathmandu, May 24As the fuel prices keep on increasing, you might have already understood that one of the reasons is the high fuel taxes levied by the government.Apparently, the fuel prices are quite high as the government collected Rs 92.78 billion in the past 10 months. Following the recent fuel price hike on Sunday, the Nepal Oil Corporation, the government-run fuel distribution monopoly, has to pay Rs 63.23 in taxes to the government for a litre of petrol. Likewise, the corporation has to pay in taxes Rs 45.91 for a litre of diesel and Rs 13.66 for a litre of kerosene.Meanwhile, the new fuel tax rate for a cylinder of cooking gas is Rs 327.27. Whereas the government is under the pressure from consumer rights activists and other stakeholders to reduce tax rates, the Ministry of Finance is not ready yet, according to an official.\n",

A big chunk of this is yet to be spent.For the next year, the amount is expected to be around Rs 10 billion, which will be sufficient for pending tasks of the Pokhara International Airport and upgrading of the Tribhuvan International Airport.\n",

The amount the country spent in this period is Rs 14 billion more than the amount recorded in the same period last year.The country imported 4,631 kg of the precious metal in the past 10 months. In the same period last year, the volume of imports was Rs 3,003 kg worth Rs 21.2 billion.Due to the 52.51 per cent increase in the volume of gold imported, the country had to spend 68.68 per cent more amount than that of the period the previous yet.

            "Food delivery services are booming in Kathmandu, but customers are not happy with their quality \n",
            "A couple of weeks back, Bintika Kafle of Kathmandu was home alone. She was hungry and unwilling to cook. But, thanks to technology, it was just a click away to get anything delivered to your doorstep. Kafle too decided to order her food online. So, she chose Pathao Food, an online app which offers food delivery services. Kafle ordered chow mein and sausage to satisfy her appetite. However, her hunger turned into anger as she had to wait for two more hours when it was supposed to be delivered in around 45 minutes. “When the food was delivered, it was cold and tasted bland,” says Kafle. While Kafle was hangry for some minutes, it did not last long as she realised it happened to her a couple of times in the past also. But, since that day, she stopped sending orders to online food delivery services.As Onlinekhabar randomly talks to customers of popular online food delivery services in Kathmandu, many share Kafle’s problem. While the business is booming at an unprecedented pace, customers say they need to focus on quality services including timely delivery. Nikunj Kayastha of Bhaktapur has also gone through similar problems. He ordered pork curry from another food delivery service, Foodmandu. His food was supposed to be delivered in half an hour, but it took one and half hours more to reach his place. “I was very disappointed with the service, the food came so late that I did not go to receive it,” says Kayastha. While the food delivery service is booming, specifically around the capital city, it has not been able to provide quality service. Most of the customers are dissatisfied with their food delivery timing. Meanwhile, some of these unsatisfied customers are taking help from social media platforms for complaining about their services. “I’ve been ordering from @foodmandu ever since they started, but I am reconsidering ever ordering from them. Food often takes over an hour and a half to arrive, sometimes two hours. And the food is usually cold,” journalist Pranaya Rana tweets.  “Either add more riders or you’re going to lose more customers like me.”Rana’s tweet follows many other comments that show disappointment against food delivery services.“They lost me in my first order. Food came three hours late than the ordered time. The lowest grade of food I ever ate…,” reads the comment by Ashis Lamicchhane. Likewise, showing disappointment towards food delivery services, another user, Snoop Hathi, following the tweet by Rana, comments, “Was given an ETA at 8. They called me at 15 past and said the earliest they could do is 9. That was it. App deleted.”Surakshya Hamal, the spokesperson at Pathao Food, presents two main reasons behind the delay in service: firstly, the weather factor, and secondly, the traffic congestion. “These days, due to the monsoon and frequent rainfall, many of the people prefer to order food to their place instead of going to restaurants,” says Hamal. “That makes the restaurants go through a lot of demand and as a result, it takes a long time to prepare food.” Similarly, in peak hours, the road traffic condition also obstructs the riders to deliver the food timely, she adds. Another food delivery service, Bhoj Deals, also takes the road traffic as the main challenge to deliver food on time. “The major challenge that we face is the traffic, which takes an hour for single order delivery. Our motive is to provide quality service to the individual customer within half an hour,” says Santosh Khadka, the customer service head at Bhoj Deals. “But due to the heavy traffic, the riders are stuck in and cannot meet the customer’s estimated time which might cause loss of food.”On the other side, riders get difficulties due to the weather, especially in the monsoon, during heavy rainfall riders even can ride the bike properly, he adds. “Sometimes, restaurants also take takes maximum time for food preparation, due to which orders get delayed.” But, the customers are not ready to accept such excuses. Nikesh Mishra of Bhaktapur who avidly use food delivery services says, “It’s acceptable that the road traffic and weather factor creates hassles for the food delivery services. But, they should also start thinking about mechanisms that would overcome those challenges.” He warns, “Otherwise they will lose their customers.” Gaurav Bista of Kathmandu also echoes Mishra. He also wants the food delivery services to think about alternatives to overcome their existing challenges. Onlinekhabar also tried to reach Foodmandu several times, but it did not respond.   \n",

Such a tendency is ultimately blamed for poor development works.The government had initially allocated Rs 378.09 billion in capital expenditure for the current fiscal year (mid-July 2021 to mid-July 2022). However, it was scaled down to Rs 340.32 billion in the budget revision.Yet, in 10 months of the year, the government has been able to spend only Rs 118.26 billion of the amount, informs the Financial Comptroller General Office. This is 31.28 per cent of the remised spending target. Now, the government can meet the target only when it spends Rs 3.6 billion every day. \n",

            "Kathmandu, May 6It has been 12 days since contractors have stopped working on development projects commissioned by the government. Contractors, citing a hike in the price of construction materials, have stopped working on over 3,500 projects across the country. This is quite worrisome as development work has completely stopped during the major season when these things should have moved forward at a rapid rate. While this is happening, the government has done nothing as all development works are in a state of coma.The effects of this are being seen in the country’s economy too as it is facing a liquidity crisis with the capital expenditure not happening as much as it should have.According to Financial Comptroller General Office, the country, after April 24, has only spent Rs 5.59 billion of the allotted capital expenditure, taking its total to Rs 107 billion. The government had planned to spend Rs 378 billion as capital expenditure. This is only 30 per cent of what it wants to spend as the government officials fear that the government will not be able to spend even 50 per cent of the money set aside as capital expenditure.The reason for halting the project is the price hike. Federation of Contractors’ Associations of Nepal‘s president Rabi Singh says the contractors will not restart projects until the government addresses the hike in prices of materials.“We need the government to address this issue because we can’t work and incur losses,” says Singh. “We’ll only start work when the government will help us and pay us accordingly.”Contractors say they have put their demands in front of ministers.

            "Kathmandu, May 4Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) is planning to purchase five new aircraft in 2022. This comes as a shock to many as NAC, which has debt in excess of Rs 47 billion, has not been paying its due instalments of the aircraft it purchased over the past decade.It has been six months since the new executive board took office. On this occasion, the board had submitted a proposal to buy five brand-new aircraft within the next six months. The corporation has not made public how it is going to manage funds to buy the new aircraft.According to NAC’s spokesperson Archana Khadka, the corporation is looking for around Rs 6.58 billion to purchase five new aircraft. She says the corporation wants new aircraft so that the corporation can provide services to remote areas of Nepal.“We want to buy three aircraft worth Rs 860 million each to fly to remote areas,” says Khadka.She says the corporation is also planning to buy two new aircraft to fly to developed areas of the country. These aircraft would cost NAC Rs 2 billion each and is part of NAC’s 10-year business plan. The plan states that after the purchase of new aircraft meant for domestic flights, the corporation will restart flights to Lukla, Pokhara, Jomsom and Bhairawaha.Further, it wants to purchase a further four aircraft to fly domestically and two narrow-body aircraft to fly internationally in 2023. The business plan also states that the corporation wants to buy one widebody and two narrowbody aircraft and expands its fleet for international flights in 2024. Khadka says the corporation wants to buy a widebody aircraft in 2025 as well.“We want to give services to Seoul (South Korea), Shangai and Guangzhou (China), Colombo (Sri Lanka), Ahmedabad  (India), Indonesia, Frankfurt (Germany) and Australia,” says Khadka.The corporation in the past had said it needed the government’s help to restart six grounded aircraft that needed maintenance. But, since the government has not batted an eye, the six Chinese aircraft are in a sorry state.\n",
